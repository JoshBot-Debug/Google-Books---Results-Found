# Google-Books---Results-Found

This program was made to scrape google books and find out what the number of results are for a search.
For example, if you search for books that mention "The Overlord" between 1/1/2000 and 1/1/2020, the results found are about 5,06,000.
Using this application you can check the number of results found for a search every year from 1950 to 2020, or any date you desire, at the end, it will create a CSV for you with the data displayed neatly.
